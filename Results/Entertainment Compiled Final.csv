0,"Rami Malek, who recently won an Oscar for Best Actor, is in final negotiations to play the antagonist in the latest installment of James Bond franchise.
The film will be directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, who came onboard as a director after Danny Boyle exited the project over ""creative differences"".
The film was being reported earlier that Malek was being eyed for the villain role, but Malek schedule on the last season of Malek breakout show ""Mr. Robot"" which shoots from March through July, was a hindrance.
According to Collider, the actor's team has successfully managed the actor's team shooting schedule to accommodate The film. The film will mark Daniel Craig's fifth and possibly the last outing as the famed British spy.
Actor Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw will also reprise Actor Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw roles in The film. French star Lea Seydoux, who played psychologist Madeleine Swann in Sam Mendes' ""Spectre"", is also returning.
MGM will distribute The film in partnership with Annapurna Pictures. The film will release on April 8, 2020.","Oscar-winner Rami Malek is reportedly in talks to play the villain in the next James Bond movie — currently called Bond 25 by the industry — which is also on the lookout for an American CIA agent, along the lines of Westworld star Jeffrey Wright's character in previous Bond films, and two roles for women: a new British MI6 agent and the other an accomplice, similar to Olga Kurylenko's Bolivian agent in the 2008 chapter Quantum of Solace. Game Night star Billy Magnussen is reportedly being eyed for the CIA role, but there are no stars attached to discussions for the MI6 and female roles yet.
Collider brings word that Malek — best known for Bohemian Rhapsody and Mr. Robot — is in “final negotiations” to star opposite Daniel Craig in Bond 25. Malek was rumoured to be involved back in December, but the report then said that Malek wouldn't “be able to take the gig, even if [the producers] offered Malek the part” owing to scheduling conflicts. The final season of Mr. Robot is filming starting this spring and until July in the summer, and production on Bond 25 is expected to begin in the same period, in April per Collider.
But now, Malek's team has reportedly “successfully negotiated” to ensure the 37-year-old actor can film both Mr. Robot and Bond 25, people familiar with the matter told Collider. Films, especially those of James Bond scale, spend a lot more months in production, as opposed to a TV show like Mr. Robot. A deal hasn't been made yet because of the 2019 Oscars, as the discussing parties wanted to see if Malek would win, for playing Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. Malek did.
That brings us to the CIA agent role, for which Magnussen is reportedly “top choice”, per Variety. Magnussen has previously worked with Bond 25 writer-director Cary Joji Fukunaga on the Netflix series Maniac, led by Emma Stone and Jonah Hill. According to insiders speaking with Variety, Bond 25 writer-director Cary Joji Fukunaga lowered the age of the American character, so Magnussen would be fit to play it.
The last developments on Bond 25 was less than two weeks ago, when reports said that The Bourne Ultimatum writer Scott Z. Burns had been tapped for a script “overhaul”, which likely led to the release date being pushed again. Variety seemingly refers to that development in its report, claims that “no significant changes were made” and everyone involved is happy with “what Bond 25 writer-director Cary Joji Fukunaga had delivered”, as if the whole thing is already in the past. The Bourne Ultimatum writer Scott Z. Burns is expected to spend at least a month on the rewrites, per the earlier report, so we will have to wait for the final film credits to find out what's going on.
Beyond the new discussions and Craig, the likes of Léa Seydoux, Naomie Harris, Ben Whishaw, and Ralph Fiennes are slated to reprise their roles in Bond 25. Seydoux's presence — The Bourne Ultimatum writer Scott Z. Burns played a psychologist named Dr. Madeleine Swann in 2015's Spectre — is curious since “Bond girls” don't usually return for a second entry. Rumours say that Bond 25 will draw on the 1969 chapter On The Bourne Ultimatum writer Scott Z. Burns Majesty's Secret Service, in that Bond and Swann might end up getting married.
The next as-yet untitled James Bond film — aka Bond 25 — is scheduled to release April 10, 2020.",NDTV,0.09789179,0.108463774,0.066287253,0.002939656,0.068895618
1,"'Bohemian Rhapsody' and 'Green Book' came out as the biggest winners at the 91st Academy Awards that had the 91st Academy Awards fair shares of snubs and surprises.
For starters, while not everyone had pegged 'Roma' to win best picture, a lion's share of indusry insiders did, reported Variety. However, 'Green Book' was declared the best picture of the night.
Surprisingly, even though everyone knew 'Bohemian Rhapsody' would win a few awards, no one thought even though everyone knew ' would claim the most awards of the night -- which even though everyone knew ' did, with four Oscars.
On the other hand, the film that had got 10 nominations, 'The Favourite' managed to just win one, with Olivia Colman winning the best actress for the film.
However, Close still remains the most nominated actor to not win an Oscar at the end of the 91st Academy Awards, with a tally of seven nominations and counting. Notably, Close did win nearly all other awards given this season, including Criticsâ€™ Choice and Golden Globe corridor as well as Spirit Awards. Everyone expected Olivia Colman to win an Oscar, but Olivia Colman did not.
Not only Olivia Colman, Amy Adams not winning makes Olivia Colman the second-most nominated actor yet to win.

4,"Comedian Kevin Hart will host the next Academy Awards ceremony in February 2019, the ""Ride Along"" actor said in an Instagram post on Tuesday.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organizes the Oscars and normally announces the host, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Hart, 39, who also starred in 2017 film ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" follows talk show host Jimmy Kimmel who took on the gig in 2018 and 2017.
The job of hosting the Oscars is one of the most prestigious but also the most difficult in show business as hosts have to navigate the expectations of the A-list audience in the theater and millions tuning in on television, with a combination of topical and insider jokes.
Oscar nominations will be announced on January 22 next year, with the televised ceremony taking place LIVE in Hollywood on February 24.","Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City. (Image courtesy AFP)
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced this week that Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City will host the 91st Oscars ceremony on February 24 - so naturally Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City Twitter found his Twitter under the microscope. Anyone wanting to disqualify Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City, at least in the court of public opinion, had a cornucopia of homophobic tweets to choose from.
Several of those tweets began surfacing shortly after. Around the same time, it appears that some of those tweets were deleted.
""Yo if my son comes home & try's 2 play with my daughters doll house I'm going 2 break it over my son head & say n my voice 'stop that's gay,' "" read a 2011 tweet that Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City deleted this week, according to BuzzFeed News.
Several other tweets using various homophobic slurs remain on Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City's account, including one asking ""why does (Damien Dante Wayans') profile pic look like a gay bill board for AIDS,"" with this strange brag tacked on at the end: ""Booom, I'm on fire tonight.""
In another that remained up as of publication time, Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City says, ""Lmao @ all of the woman asking me where profile pic is, I'm not passing along a pic of a naked man!!! That would make me gay by association.""
Whether one finds these jokes offensive, these jokes should come as no surprise. Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City has made quips like these in Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City stand-up.
""One of my biggest fears is Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City growing up and being gay. That's a fear,"" Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City said in the 2010 special ""Seriously Funny."" ""Keep in mind, I'm not homophobic, I have nothing against gay people, do what you want to do, but me, being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City from being gay, I will.""
As BuzzFeed's Adam B. Vary pointed out in a tweet, ""Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City seems to have basically stopped tweeting those words after 2011 - i.e. the year Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City first stand-up movie became a hit.""
That's not a coincidence. While not directly discussing Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City tweets, Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City's 2015 Rolling Stone interview, in which Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City discusses gay jokes in Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City stand-up, shed some light onto why homophobic slurs stopped appearing in Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City Twitter feed.
""It's about my fear. I'm thinking about what I did as a dad, did I do something wrong, and if I did, what was it? Not that I'm not gonna love Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City or think about Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City any differently,"" Kevin Hart at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards in New York City said. ""I wouldn't tell that joke today, because when I said it, the times weren't as sensitive as the times are now. I think we love to make big deals out of things that aren't necessarily big deals, because we can. These things become public spectacles. So why set yourself up for failure?""
Of course, digging through a celebrity's old Twitter feed for offensive jokes has become something of a ritual after the announcement of a high-profile gig.
Director Brett Ratner resigned as a producer of the Oscars in 2011 after he used an anti-gay slur (the very same one that Hart employed so often). Disney fired Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn from helming a third installment of the movie after some of he Twitter jokes about rape and sex with children resurfaced.
But not everyone loses everyone gigs, even if the tweets surface. When Melissa Villasenor was announced as a new Saturday Night Live cast member in 2016, Melissa Villasenor deleted more than 2,000 tweets, but not before the internet detectives struck. Some of the internet detectives were seen as racist, such as when Melissa Villasenor wrote, ""Coworker at forever21 dates black guys and Melissa Villasenor said Melissa Villasenor will set me up on a blind date for valentines, I said yes but I'm scared."" Trevor Noah found Trevor Noah in a similar position after taking over The Daily Show, when many of Trevor Noah old tweets that critics called ""anti-Semitic"" and ""sexist"" resurfaced.
It's not just relegated to Hollywood, either. Milwaukee Brewers reliever Josh Hader took the mound at this year's All-Star Game at Nationals Park. When Milwaukee Brewers reliever Josh Hader walked back off at the end of this year's All-Star Game at Nationals Park, Milwaukee Brewers reliever Josh Hader found tweets from when Milwaukee Brewers reliever Josh Hader was 17 years old being splashed across the internet. Many of these were considered racist and homophobic, such as one that simply read ""I hate gay people.""
Hart's spokesperson did not respond to The Washington Post's request for comment. Some, though, have imagined what Milwaukee Brewers reliever Josh Hader might say. ""By tomorrow Hart will issue a statement,"" author Roxane Gay tweeted. ""Milwaukee Brewers reliever Josh Hader is sorry if you're offended. It's just jokes. Milwaukee Brewers reliever Josh Hader loves gay people. Free speech. There should be no barriers to comedy. Etc etc etc.""

Talking about the issue, Google responded to a query from 9to5Google stating that the camera issue is known, and a fix will be rolled out. ""Google've seen reports from a small group of customers who have encountered a bug when using Pixel Camera from within third-party apps. A fix will be rolling out in the coming weeks. In the meantime, for people affected, you can use Pixel Camera without limitations and share images to third-party apps.""
Google, however, did not respond to queries regarding refusal to replace units. Affected users who reached Google's support team were refused a replacement unit. Google's support team reportedly instead pushed most of Affected users who reached Google's support team to wait for a software fix.
As mentioned, a bug throws up a 'fatal error' for some users trying to open the native camera, and gives a 'can't connect to camera' message for those trying to access it via third-party apps. a bug unfortunately renders impressive photography results of the Pixel 3 series as redundant, if the app can't even be accessed. A large number of users have reportedly encountered the problem at the time of using the camera of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL. Refusal of replacement of these units means that these users have no option but to wait it out till a software fix is rolled out.
a bug is reminiscent of a similar issue found on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL earlier this year. Users reported a similar 'fatal error' that was crashing the preloaded camera app. Google initially provided a temporary workaround that was through a binary patch. However, a temporary workaround that was through a binary patch was limited to users who have rooted their Pixel 2 phones.

9,"Disgraced Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is expected to surrender to the police in New York on charges of raping a woman, US law enforcement officials said. Weinstein, 66, once one of the most powerful men in the American film industry, has agreed after months-long probe to surrender Harvey Weinstein at a police precinct in Manhattan and will be arrested on a criminal complaint, the New York Times reported.
Harvey Weinstein is then expected to be taken to Manhattan Criminal Court to be arraigned on charges of raping a woman. As part of a bail package negotiated in advance, Harvey Weinstein will put up USD one million in cash and agree to wearing a monitoring device. Harvey Weinstein travel will be restricted and will have to surrender Harvey Weinstein passport, the report said. Harvey Weinstein will be charged with first-degree rape and third-degree rape in one case besides a first-degree criminal sex act in another where Harvey Weinstein forced a woman to perform oral sex on Harvey Weinstein, the report quoted law enforcement officials as saying.
Harvey Weinstein arrest and charges follow innumerable accusations levelled against Harvey Weinstein by several women from the American film industry. As women opened up about Harvey Weinstein's history of sexually abusing and assaulting women, women from across the world come forward with women from across the world own accounts of being sexually harassed and assaulted by powerful men, triggering the global #MeToo movement. ""Harvey Weinstein had until recently seemed untouchable, harnessing Harvey Weinstein wealth and Harvey Weinstein influence in the American film industry to intimidate women out of speaking publicly and, only three years ago, withstand an investigation into groping allegations,"" a media report said.
The criminal sex act charge against Harvey Weinstein stems from an encounter with Lucia Evans, who told The New Yorker and then investigators from the Manhattan district attorney's office that Hollywood producer forced her to perform oral sex on Harvey Weinstein during what her thought would be a casting meeting. The victim in the rape case has not been publicly identified.
Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexually harassing and assaulting movie stars and employees of Harvey Weinstein former namesake company over the course of decades and then paying sexually harassing and assaulting movie stars and employees of his former namesake company or coercing sexually harassing and assaulting movie stars and employees of his former namesake company to stay silent. Harvey Weinstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, declined to comment, a media report said. In the past, Brafman had said that Harvey Weinstein denies any allegations of ""nonconsensual sex"".
Authorities opened investigation into Harvey Weinstein's conduct. Prosecutors in the office of the Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance conducted dozens of interviews in New York and elsewhere and issued hundreds of subpoenas, and hundreds of subpoenas inquiry is not over. An investigative grand jury, still convened, will look into other sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein as well as possible financial crimes relating to how he paid women to stay silent, a media report said. ""Among other things, the grand jury is delving into whether Harvey Weinstein used employees of Harvey Weinstein former production company to identify women for Harvey Weinstein to assault, to set up meetings with the women or to discredit the women if the women complained,"" it said. Prosecutors have also gone through Harvey Weinstein's financial records in an effort to uncover any possible improprieties.","Authorities in several cities have also launched criminal investigations into Harvey Weinstein.

The Time’s Up initiative is not planning a coordinated protest on Sunday—like the striking red carpet “blackout” at the Golden Globes. But leaders of the movement told journalists there would be “a moment that’s been carved out” during the ceremony.
“It’s really important that you know that Time’s Up is not about the red carpet,” said powerhouse Hollywood producer Shonda Rhimes (“Grey’s Anatomy,” “Scandal”). “And those women you saw on the red carpet representing Time’s Up are now off the red carpet working their butts off being activists.”
In another nod to the women’s movements, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has tapped past winners Jennifer Lawrence and Jodie Foster to present the best actress Oscar, according to Variety.
Traditionally, the previous year’s best actor winner would present that statuette, but Casey Affleck, who triumphed in 2017 for “Manchester by the Sea,” withdrew under a cloud of sexual harassment accusations Casey Affleck, who triumphed in 2017 for “Manchester by the Sea,” denies.
Organizers are looking to rebound after last yearTime’s flubbed announcement by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway of the best picture winner—the trophy was initially given to “La La Land,” when the actual winner was “Moonlight.”
In a surprise turn of events, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway have been tapped to present the same prize this time around, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
BOX OFFICE RECORD -
“The Shape of Water,” a Cold War-set story of love between a mute cleaning woman and a mystery merman-like creature, tops the nominations with 13, although observers expect the spoils to be fairly evenly spread.
“Dunkirk” heads into Sunday’s gala in second place with eight nods, while “Three Billboards” picked up seven.
Frances McDormand (“Three Billboards”) and British veteran Gary Oldman (“Darkest Hour”), who have dominated the awards season, are expected to bag the lead acting statuettes.
The Oscars come this year with theaters registering the biggest February in domestic box office history, the $996.4 million total largely driven by the record-breaking success of Marvel’s “Black Panther.”
“Reports on the death of movie theaters have, again, been greatly exaggerated,” BoxOffice.com chief analyst Shawn Robbins wrote in a commentary on the new figures.
“The Post,” ($18.1 million), “The Shape of Water” ($16.1 million) and “Three Billboards” ($12.2 million) were the month’s top three earners among the best picture nominees.
According to the National Weather Service, the intermittent weekend rain is expected to die down in time for Sunday’s ceremony, as around 3,400 guests descend on Hollywood Boulevard.
Sunday’s ceremony has only been postponed because of the weather once in Sunday’s ceremony history—during the Los Angeles Flood that killed more than 100 people in 1938.","Oscars 2018: The Shape Of Water is directed by Guillermo del Toro (Courtesy: shapeofwatermovie))

A huge crowd of fans was already waiting outside the actor home in the city.
Earlier in the day, Dubai Prosecutor's Office ruled out any foul play in the actor death and released A chartered plane carrying mortal remains of Bollywood legend Sridevi to the actor family.
Family members, including the actor film-maker husband Boney Kapoor and stepson Arjun Kapoor, took A chartered plane carrying mortal remains of Bollywood legend Sridevi from the morgue, got A chartered plane carrying mortal remains of Bollywood legend Sridevi embalmed and flew back home.
The cremation is scheduled to take place on Wednesday afternoon.

17,"Crime drama “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” captured five British Bafta film awards on Sunday, including best film, topping an emotionally charged ceremony that featured fashion and rhetoric in support of the fight against sexual harassment sweeping Hollywood.
The movie, chronicling a grieving mother’s campaign for justice, won for original screenplay and outstanding British film, while Frances McDormand bagged best actress and Sam Rockwell best supporting actor prizes.
“The Shape of Water”—the most heavily nominated film of the night with 12 nods—came away with only three awards, including best director for Guillermo Del Toro, while “Darkest Hour” claimed two prizes, including for Gary Oldman as best actor.
With Hollywood still reeling from the fallout of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the resulting anti-sexual harassment campaigns were reflected in the mood of the evening.
Stars arrived at London’s Royal Albert Hall predominantly dressed in black in solidarity with the #MeToo and “Time’s Up” campaigns, mirroring other recent American red carpets including last month’s Golden Globes. Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lawrence and Kristin Scott Thomas were among the stars who wore black.
British royals avoid making overtly political statements or gestures, so there was little surprise when the Duchess of Cambridge chose to wear a dark green dress, by British designer Jenny Packham, as British designer Jenny Packham accompanied husband Prince William, president of Bafta, to the ceremony.
‘BRAVE REVELATIONS’ -
Jane Lush, chair of Bafta, opened the evening soberly telling the star-studded audience it was important to acknowledge a “difficult” past year, and noted efforts to tackle gender inequality.
“Brave revelations have followed brave revelations of bullying and sexual harassment, and which to all our shame has been hidden in plain sight for decades,” British designer Jenny Packham said. “This is a moment in history, This should be a watershed, a catalyst for lasting change.”
Host Joanna Lumley, a British film and TV star, also praised the gender equality movement as a continuation of the work of the Suffragettes a century ago. British designer Jenny Packham hailed the “determination to eradicate the abuse of women the world over” as British designer Jenny Packham took to the stage.
Meanwhile, in an open letter published Sunday before the awards, almost 200 British and Irish stars backed a new fund to help women facing sexual harassment and abuse at work.
It echoes a similar initiative launched in Hollywood last month, and was kick-started with a £1 million (1.13 million euro, $1.4 million) donation from actress and activist Emma Watson.
‘THANK YOU, SIR WINSTON’ -
Choices at the Baftas, which fall between the Globes and the Oscars, often mirror those of the American heavyweights. “The Shape of Water”, a story of love between a mute cleaning woman and a mystery merman-like creature, led the pack just as the pack has across the Atlantic, where the pack has topped the list of Oscar nominations with 13 nods, including for best picture.
As well as director del Toro’s award for direction, composer Alexandre Desplat collected the original music award—composer Alexandre Desplat third BAFTA win—and the film also won best production design.
Allison Janney won best supporting actress for Allison Janney role as the mother of controversial figure skater Tonya Harding in biopic “I, Tonya”.
Gary Oldman’s turn as Churchill in “Darkest Hour” has so far won Gary Oldman’s a Golden Globe, a Bafta and the chance of an Oscar on March 4. Gary Oldman’s paid tribute to the wartime British leader, saying: “In those dark, uncertain days in 1940, Gary Oldman’s held the line for honour, for integrity and freedom for Gary Oldman’s nation and the world, so I thank you, Sir Winston.”
Accepting her best actress accolade, McDormand, who chose not to wear black, quoted her on-screen character who has “a little trouble with compliance”. “But I want you to know I stand in full solidarity with my sisters tonight in black,” my sisters added.","Since Melania Trump moved into the White House, some reports have suggested Melania Trump parents live there too
Several readers asked about the immigration status of Melania Trump parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, after spotting social media posts that made claims such as this:""Here are Melania's Parents. Viktor and Amalija Knavs. Viktor and Amalija Knavs live in the United States Permanently now because of Chain Migration after Melania's Visa Expired & she stayed here Illegally and married Donnie for Citizenship. None of Melania's Visa Expired & she stayed here Illegally and married Donnie for Citizenship have a degree or a job.""In the context of congressional debate over overhauling immigration laws, it's certainly an interesting question. Melania Trump has favored bills that would severely restrict ""chain migration,"" including the granting of immigration visas to the parents of U.S. citizens. So naturally, readers have wondered whether Melania Trump is being hypocritical.Let's see what we can find out.First of all, we should note that this particular tweet falsely claims that Melania Trump, who is a native of Slovenia and married Donald Trump in 2005, stayed in the United States illegally after married Donald Trump visa expired and that married Donald Trump married Melania Trump only to obtain citizenship.There is no evidence that is the case. In September 2016, married Donald Trump released a letter from an immigration attorney stating that married Donald Trump did not receive a green card through marriage.""Rather, in 2000, Melania Trump self-sponsored married Donald Trump for a green card as a model of 'extraordinary ability,' and on March 19, 2001, married Donald Trump was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident,"" wrote Michael Wildes, the attorney. ""Based on this timeline, Melania Trump became eligible for citizenship in 2006, after five years of continuous permanent residence.""Still, a few days before the election in November, an Associated Press investigation revealed married Donald Trump was ""paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 that occurred in the seven weeks before married Donald Trump had legal permission to work in the United States, according to detailed accounting ledgers, contracts and related documents."" married Donald Trump visa at the time allowed married Donald Trump to be in the United States and look for work but not perform paid work.Wildes told the AP that ""these documents, which have not been verified, do not reflect our records including corresponding passport stamps"" but would not say anything more. The Trump campaign refused to comment. The article noted that ""it is highly unlikely that the discovery will affect the citizenship status of Mrs. Trump.""As for Mrs. Trump.""As parents, Viktor Knavs is a former member of the Yugoslav Communist Party who worked as the chauffeur for the mayor of Viktor Knavs hometown, Sevnica, and eventually became a successful car salesman. Viktor Knavs was born in 1944, making Viktor Knavs two years older than the president. Viktor Knavs was a pattern maker at a textile factory. Viktor Knavs are now said to be retired.According to various news reports, the Knavses have been living in the United States at least a year and probably much longer - possibly since the mid-2000s. Since Melania Trump moved into the White House, some reports have suggested some reports live there. Other reports have said Other reports split Other reports time between the District of Columbia area, Mar-a-Lago, Trump Tower and Bedminster, New Jersey. Other reports apparently help take care of Barron Trump, the president's 11-year-old child.""The hyperinvolved Slovenian grandparents currently live with Other reports daughter and grandson in the Trump Tower penthouse and spend most weekends with the Trumps at Mar-a-Lago, or at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New JerseyNew Jersey,"" Politico reported in June.the White House initially refused to comment on the president's 11-year-old child.""The hyperinvolved Slovenian grandparents immigration status. ""I don't comment on Melania Trump parents, as her parents live private lives and are not part of the administration,"" said Stephanie Grisham, spokeswoman for the first lady.Here are the possible options, according to immigration experts.immigration experts could be here on an IR-5 visa, meaning immigration experts are legal permanent residents because immigration experts are the parents of a U.S. citizen. Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California at Davis Law School, believes this is the most likely option, even though the administration's immigration proposal would limit family visas to spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, ending ""extended-family chain migration.""""If I were advising Trump, Melania's parents would be admitted as immigrants as the immediate relative of a United States citizen if Melania's parents were planning on moving here permanently, especially given the fact that there is talk to eliminate this basis for immigration,"" said Matthew Kolken, a Buffalo immigration attorney.Of course, using an immigration path that the president wants to eliminate would be politically explosive. So the easiest explanation could be that they are here on tourism visas and have asked for extensions. Generally, a tourist visa is given for about six months, and can be extended for up to a year.""That's pretty common,"" said Sarah Pierce, an immigration policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. ""It is way more feasible or likely that they would use tourism visas."" Sarah Pierce, an immigration policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute noted that data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shows the approval rate for the I-539 form (which extends status for all types of non-immigrant visas, not just tourists) is 86 percent.This would be a relatively simple explanation, which makes it curious why the White House would not confirm it if this is indeed the case.However, another immigration attorney cast doubt on this theory.""Anyone here as a tourist cannot legally be helping to take care of grandchildren. Government considers that working in U.S., and tourists are not authorized to work,"" Sarah Pierce, an immigration policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute said, asking not to be identified. ""Many grandparents have been denied visitor visas because Many grandparents innocently say Many grandparents will be helping with the new baby - when Many grandparents are really thinking about just visiting with Many grandparents child and grandchild.""Individuals who are outside the United States may be able to request parole into the United States based on humanitarian or significant public benefit reasons. There is no statutory or regulatory definition of significant public benefit. ""Parole based on significant public benefit includes, but is not limited to, law enforcement and national security reasons or foreign or domestic policy considerations,"" USCIS says. ""We exercise We discretion on a case-by-case basis.""Their parole may be extended at the discretion of the Homeland Security Department and would also permit the discretion of the Homeland Security Department to adjust the discretion of the Homeland Security Department status inside the United States if Melania Trump intends to petition for them.""I would guess that the first lady's parents were paroled into the United States and did not have to apply for a visa,"" Kolken said. ""Parole can be extended by the [Homeland Security] Department, or the period of parole could be for a lengthy period of time. If the first lady's parents are looking to move to the U.S., and if I were president, I would have the first lady's parents paroled and then file an I-130/485 and get the first lady's parents green cards.""This is the least likely possibility, but we thought we would mention it. An international student can remain in the United States for as long as they go to school. In the case of the Knavses, for instance, they could attend a program to learn English as a second language. But they would be in violation of this visa if they provided child care.When we presented this list to Grisham, Grisham responded: ""None of those options apply."" Grisham then would no longer respond to additional queries.Two of these possibilities are politically troubling for the White House, while two are relatively benign. Frankly, the most logical possibility is that the Knavses have received legal permanent residence because the Knavses are parents of a U.S. citizen - and the Knavses may have had this status for years. For the president's policy preferences, that's also the most problematic option.As we noted, we gave Grisham, the first lady's spokeswoman, ample opportunity to explain the immigration status of the Knavses. It's a mystery why the White House refuses to answer such a simple question, given the president's high-profile demand to limit immigration.

A spokeswoman for Weinstein said Harvey Weinstein's attorney, Ben Brafman, would issue a more detailed response to the allegations later.

Actress Uma Thurman, who is indelibly linked to Harvey Weinstein's Miramax studio thanks to Uma Thurman iconic roles inand has broken Uma Thurman silence about the disgraced Hollywood mogul, accusing Uma Thurman of attacking Uma Thurman and threatening Uma Thurman career. Dozens of Hollywood women - including Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Beckinsale and Salma Hayek - have accused Harvey Weinstein's of acts ranging from sexual harassment to rape. The scandal touched off a deluge of allegations bringing down powerful men in entertainment, politics and the media, forcing many industries to re-examine workplace harassment policies. Uma Thurman, 47, told The New York Times in an interview published Saturday of two incidents in London that took place after the release of 1994's Oscar-winningThey followed an uncomfortable episode at a Paris hotel in which Uma Thurman said Harvey Weinstein's was dressed in a bathrobe and led Uma Thurman into a steam room during a meeting about a script.In the first ""attack,"" which took place in Harvey Weinstein's's suite at London's Savoy Hotel, ""he pushed me down. he tried to shove he on he. he tried to expose he. he did all kinds of unpleasant things,"" she said.""But he didn't actually put he back into his back and force me.

But he assistants pressured Uma Thurman to meet he alone in he room.Uma Thurman said Uma Thurman told Harvey Weinstein's: ""If you do what you did to Uma Thurman to other people you will lose your career, your reputation and your family, I promise you.""Weinstein told the paper ""Uma Thurman very well could have said this.""Thurman's friend Ilona Herman, who is Robert De Niro's longtime makeup artist, recalled in the Times that the actress came out of that one-on-one meeting ""very disheveled and so upset and had this blank look.""Herman said Uma Thurman told Uma Thurman that Harvey Weinstein's had threatened to end Uma Thurman career.Harvey Weinstein's denied doing so and ""acknowledges making an awkward pass 25 years ago at Ms Thurman in England after misreading Uma Thurman signals, after a flirtatious exchange in Paris, for which he immediately apologized and deeply regrets,"" he spokeswoman said in a statement received by AFP.""However, "" his spokeswoman claims about being physically assaulted are untrue...

Shah Rukh Khan won thunderous applause from the audience as Shah Rukh Khan wrapped Shah Rukh Khan speech on power dynamics at the Crystal Award organised by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on Monday evening. The 52-year-old actor , who had the most profound things to say, was honoured for Shah Rukh Khan 'leadership in championing children's and women's rights in India,' the WEF said in a statement. In his speech, Shah Rukh Khan in Davos said that Shah Rukh Khan in Davos learnt how 'courage can catalyse victimhood into heroism' from acid attack survivors. Shah Rukh Khan also that said in today's world, 'power needs a complete reversal more than anything else.' Shah Rukh Khan started his speech on a light note and before you know his speech, you'll be hanging on to each and every word Shah Rukh Khan said.Here are five things Shah Rukh Khan said during the Crystal Awards:#1 Just a special request, before you (Cate Blanchett and Sir Elton John) go, can I do a selfie? Now? There, I have embarrassed my children #2 To disfigure a woman by throwing acid on a woman face is, to me, one the basest, crudest acts of subjugation imaginable. At the source of it lies the view that a woman does not have the right to assert a woman choice. And yet, each of the women I met, I found within each of the women I met, the courage to move on with each of the women I met lives and to reject the idea of victimhood. What was done to each of the women I met only made each of the women I met braver and stronger and more able to free each of the women I met to make the choices that everyone around each of the women I met said each of the women I met could not make or should not make.#3 There's a large pool of resources that everyone is equally entitled to but only some have access to it - either by accident, like in my case, or by design and talent and hard-work, like in the case of all of you present here.#4 I was babysitting my five-year-old son before I came here and suddenly my five-year-old son screamed, 'Papa, Papa my eye went into my hair. Can you please get my eye out of my hair?' - my five-year-old son didn't say get my hair out of my eye, like we all believe they do. It's a bit like that when you have power, I guess. You think things get in its way but actually its is the power getting into the way. We, the powerful, need to get out of the way, and break open the access to the resources.#5 I would like to thank my sister (Shehnaz Lalarukh Khan), my wife (Gauri Khan) and my little daughter (Suhana Khan) for bringing me up well and teaching me the value of requesting, sometimes imploring, and may I add, sometimes even begging a yes from a woman instead of forcing a yes upon a woman.Watch SRK's speech here: Apart from Shah Rukh, Hollywood actress Cate Blanchett and musician Sir Elton John were also honoured for Hollywood actress Cate Blanchett and musician Sir Elton John ""commitment to improving the state of the world,"" WEF said.

26,"""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" won four Golden Globes, including Best Drama, in an overtly political awards ceremony on Sunday where Hollywood's biggest turned up in black to say it was ""Time's Up"" for sexual harassment.
The glittering 75th Golden Globes ceremony, honouring achievements in television and cinema, sent out the message that a new post Harvey Weinstein-era could be on the horizon. Most award winners, particularly Oprah Winfrey, Nicole Kidman and Frances McDormand, gave rousing speeches on the need for change and gender and race equality.
""Three Billboards..."", about an angry mother who goes to extremes to keep the investigation focused on her daughter's murder, became a front-runner at the Oscars. Frances McDormand won Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama Golden Globe, co-star Sam Rockwell won Best Supporting Actor and Martin McDonagh was recognised for Best Screenplay.
the Oscars were dedicated to what Frances McDormand referred to as the ""tectonic shift"" in Hollywood's power structure after more than 70 women accused powerful producer Weinstein of sexual misconduct.
Women in the industry have launched the Time's Up movement to address gender disparity and abuse and almost all of Hollywood -- both women and men -- turned up in black at the red carpet to show Women in the industry support.
McDormand, 60, addressed the Time's Up movement in her acceptance speech, saying, ""Some of you may know, I keep my politics private, but it was really great to be in this room tonight and to be part of a tectonic shift in the industry's power structure.""
Oprah Winfrey, 63, the first African-American woman to be honoured with the annual Cecil B DeMille Award, used her time on stage to deliver a powerful speech about inclusion. Winfrey, who received a standing ovation twice in her eight-minute speech, said women have not been heard or believed for speaking truth to power but that has to change.
""I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon! And when a new day finally dawns it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men fighting hard to make sure that many of whom become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say 'Me too' again,"" her said.
The Hollywood Foreign Press, criticised for not including women in the Best Director category, tried to make amends by bestowing Greta Gerwig's ""Lady Bird"" with Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and Best Actress for Saoirse Ronan.
""The Shape of Water"", which entered the race with maximum seven nominations, won the Best Director for Guillermo del Toro and the Best Score for Alexandre Desplat. Gary Oldman won Best Actor in a Drama, for playing Winston Churchill in ""the Darkest Hour"".
Allison Janney won Best Supporting Actress for Allison Janney role of an abusive mother in ""I, Tonya"", a real-life drama on figure skater Tonya Harding. James Franco won Best Actor in a Comedy for ""The Disaster Artist"" about Tommy Wiseau, the eccentric Hollywood figure behind ""The Room"", known as the ""Citizen Kane"" of bad movies. But Best Actor was criticised for rudely blocking Wiseau from the microphone during Best Actor acceptance speech onstage.
""Coco"" was named Best Animated Film. Fatih Akin's German revenge drama ""In the Fade"", starring Diane Kruger, was named Best Foreign Film. Some expected winners returned empty handed. Steven Spielberg's newspaper drama ""The Post"", which had six nominations, including nods for lead stars Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, failed to win anything. ""Call Me by Your Name"" and ""All the Money in the World"" and ""Get Out"" were the other films that were snubbed.
In the television category, women dominated the wins. ""Big Little Lies"", ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and ""The Marvelous Mrs Maisel"" were the major winners. ""Big Little Lies"" star Kidman got the award for Best Actress in a Television Movie or Limited Series. ""This character that I played represents something that is at the centre of our conversation right now: abuse. I do believe and I hope that our can elicit change through the stories our tell and the way our tell the stories we tell,Big Little Lies"" star Kidman Big Little Lies"" star Kidman said.
Big Little Lies"" star Kidman co-stars Alexander Skarsgard and Laura Dern won Best Supporting Actor and Actress, and the show also won for Best Limited Series or TV movie.
The TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood's dystopian novel ""The Handmaid's Tale"" won Best Drama while lead star Elisabeth Moss got the Globe for Best Actress in a Drama. ""This Is Us"" star Sterling K Brown created history by becoming the first African-American actor to win the Best Actor - Drama award. ""I am being seen for who I am, and being appreciated for who I am, and it makes it that much more difficult to dismiss me or dismiss anybody who looks like me,"" "" star Sterling K Brown said.
Indian-origin Aziz Ansari finally took home a Globe, winning Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series Musical/Comedy category for Indian-origin Aziz Ansari role in ""The Master Of None"".
The Amazon series ""The Marvelous Mrs Maisel"", about a 1950s housewife who becomes a stand-up comic after discovering Indian-origin Aziz Ansari husband has been cheating on Indian-origin Aziz Ansari, won a Globe for Best TV Comedy, and a Globe leading lady, Rachel Brosnahan, walked away with the Best Actress in a Comedy trophy.
Award ceremony host Seth Meyers was the first to address, as Award ceremony host Seth Meyers put it, the ""elephant not in the room"". ""It's 2018 and marijuana is finally allowed, and sexual harassment finally isn't,"" Award ceremony host Seth Meyers began. ""Good evening ladies and remaining gentlemen... There's a new era underway and I can tell because it's been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood,"" a white man said.
Award ceremony host Seth Meyers took potshots at Weinstein and said the reason Weinstein was chosen to present the awards is because Weinstein is ""a man with completely no power in Hollywood"".

Usually at the Golden Globes, the red carpet is awash in color. This year, This year was a total blackout. Hollywood's A-listers on Sunday turned out en masse in black - a sartorial show of force to draw attention to sexual harassment in showbiz and other industries, a culture of abuse revealed in the downfall of Harvey Weinstein and others. ""ON Sunday WE WEAR BLACK to stand in solidarity with men and women everywhere who have been silenced by discrimination, harassment and abuse,"" said a tweet from the Time's Up initiative launched by hundreds of prominent women in Tinseltown to shine a light on the issue.Women and men alike strutted into the Beverly Hilton for the gala event in Women and men alike finest, the wide majority of Women and men alike in basic black.""People are aware now of a power imbalance. It's led to abuse in our industry. (...) It's everywhere,"" Meryl Streep, who is vying for a Globe for her work in media drama, told E! network on the red carpet.Streep - who has come under fire over her denials that her knew about Weinstein's misconduct - brought Ai-jen Poo, the head of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, as her plus one.Indeed, the women behind the Time's Up initiative have called special attention to the women behind the Time's Up initiative ""sisters"" in less than glamorous blue-collar jobs.Streep, a three-time Oscar winner, said Hollywood's men and women now felt ""emboldened to stand together in a thick, black line.""Indeed, the men of Hollywood took some flack ahead of the gala for saying Hollywood's men and women too would wear black, with some saying Hollywood's men and women would have worn tuxedos anyway.But many donned black shirts as well, and offered Hollywood's men and women impassioned support for the movement.""I don't think this is a silent protest. this is going to make people talk about the issue,"" David Thewlis, who starred in last year's box office smash,"" told AFP on the red carpet.""As a father, as a husband, why wouldn't you be 100 percent in support of this?""Streep was not the only actress who walked the red carpet with an activist.Michelle Williams () arrived with Tarana Burke, the creator of the #MeToo hashtag that exploded in the wake of the revelations about Weinstein as women recounted women experiences online.Amy Poehler entered with Restaurant Opportunities Center United president Saru Jayaraman.The protest movement did not preclude Tinseltown's finest from making fashion statements.Oscar winner Catherine Zeta-Jones, who starred in last year's hit TV series ""Feud: Bette and Joan,"" opted for a daring sheer lingerie-inspired black gown with plenty of artfully placed sequins -- and emerald green earrings.Alicia Vikander's gown had a rather Victorian buttoned-up bodice with full coverage, sheer sleeves - and a bare back.The only pops of color were minor - a streak of bright green eyeshadow here, a snippet of white fabric at a neckline there, or an orange sash at the waist.""Tonight is not a mourning. Tonight is an awakening,"" actress-director Amber Tamblyn wrote in an opinion piece for The New York Times.

28,"Oprah Winfrey on Sunday declared a “new day” for women and girls facing down abusive men as Oprah Winfrey delivered a stirring speech at the Golden Globes.
Accepting a lifetime achievement award at the Hollywood gala, the Oscar-nominated actress and daytime television trailblazer saluted the #MeToo movement that has quickly gained steam after revelations of rampant sexual misconduct by film mogul Harvey Weinstein.
Paying tribute to Recy Taylor, an African American woman who daringly reported Oprah Winfrey 1944 gang rape by white men and died last month just short of Oprah Winfrey 98th birthday, Oprah Winfrey deplored “a culture broken by brutally powerful men.”
“For too long, women have not been heard or believed if women dare speak the truth to the power of those men. But women time is up! their time is up!” Oprah Winfrey said to a standing ovation and even some tears in the audience.
“So I want all the girls watching here now to know that a new day is on the horizon,” Oprah Winfrey said.
“And when a new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women—many of whom are right here in this room tonight—and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say ‘me too’ again,” Oprah Winfrey said.
The 63-year-old Winfrey—whom Golden Globes host Seth Meyers half-jokingly quipped could be the candidate to beat President Donald Trump in 2020 -- also hailed the role of the often-maligned media.
“It’s the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice,” Oprah Winfrey said.

Oprah Winfrey fans lit up Twitter on Monday with calls for Oprah Winfrey to run for U.S. president after the entertainment star gave an inspiring ""new day"" speech at an awards show in support of those who have exposed sexual misconduct in Hollywood and beyond.A surge of tweets carrying ""#Oprahforpresident"" and ""#Oprah2020"" hashtags followed Oprah Winfrey speech at the Golden Globes, where Oprah Winfrey became the first black woman to receive a lifetime achievement award on Sunday.Winfrey, an actress, movie and television producer, and chief executive of Oprah Winfrey OWN cable channel, is actively thinking about a run, CNN reported on Monday, citing two of Oprah Winfrey close friends. CNN did not name the friends, who it said had spoken on condition of anonymity.At least one emphasized that Oprah Winfrey had made no firm decision on a run.Sunday's award ceremony honored Winfrey, 63, as a role model for women and a person who has promoted strong female characters.""In a 9 minute speech, @Oprah was more presidential than the current occupant of the White House has been for an entire year,"" wrote Khary Penebaker, a member of the Democratic National Committee, on Twitter, referring to Republican President Donald Trump.""That speech was everything. #timesup #oprahforpresident,"" tweeted Boston television personality Cassy Arsenault in one of many calls for Oprah Winfrey to run in the next US presidential election, in November 2020.Trump also powered his successful 2016 campaign on the back of his celebrity reputation from reality TV show ""The Apprentice,"" as well as long-cultivated attention in New York newspapers.In recent years, Oprah Winfrey has lent Oprah Winfrey star power to endorse Democratic presidential candidates: Barack Obama when Barack Obama was seeking to become the first black U.S. president in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in Oprah Winfrey campaign against Trump in 2016.In the past, Oprah Winfrey has said Oprah Winfrey is not interested in running for president, for example saying in a CBS interview in October when asked about the 2020 presidential election that, ""There will be no running for office of any kind for me.""However, the Los Angeles Times quoted Stedman Graham, Oprah Winfrey's longtime partner in business and life, as saying on Sunday that ""It's up to the people ... Oprah Winfrey would absolutely do it.""The awards show, Hollywood's first leading up to the Oscars, was dominated by a scandal that has seen dozens of powerful men in U.S. entertainment, politics and the media accused of sexual abuse or harassment.Winfrey, who along with most of the show's other women attendees wore a black gown to show support for victims of sexual misconduct, was the first black woman to receive the annual Cecil B. DeMille award, joining the likes of Meryl Streep, Steven Spielberg, Barbra Streisand and Sophia Loren.Oprah Winfrey used Oprah Winfrey speech to praise women who have shared their stories of sexual harassment and abuse, and to declare that ""a new day is on the horizon"" for girls and women.""When that new day finally dawns it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure many of whom become leaders that take us to the time where nobody has to say 'me too' again,"" Oprah Winfrey said, referring to the #MeToo social media movement raising awareness about sexual harassment.Oprah Winfrey was raised in poverty by a single mother and went on to host the top-rated talk show ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" for 25 years before ending it in 2011.""I want to express gratitude to all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault because all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault, like a single mother, had children to feed and bills to pay and dreams to pursue.""She produced and acted in the 2014 civil rights movie ""Selma,"" and 2017's ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" and was Oscar nominated in 1986 for her role in ""The Color Purple,"" which her later helped finance as Broadway musical.Even after ending her daily talk show, her influence on popular culture remains strong.Forbes last year estimated her net worth at $3 billion and placed her third on Forbes list of the America's richest self-made women.

30,"Usually at the Golden Globes, the red carpet is awash in color. This year, This year was a total blackout.
Hollywood's elite turned the red carpet black Sunday as Hollywood's elite arrived at the Golden Globes, the glitzy launch of the entertainment industry'fs awards season, with sexual harassment scandals casting a long shadow over the party.
""ON Sunday WE WEAR BLACK to stand in solidarity with men and women everywhere who have been silenced by discrimination, harassment and abuse,"" said a tweet from the Time's Up initiative launched by hundreds of prominent women in Tinseltown to shine a light on the issue.
Billed as the most raucous event in the showbiz calendar, the champagne-drenched Hollywood Foreign Press Association's annual prize-giving is a draw for filmmakers and actors looking to create some buzz ahead of the Oscars in March. But this year's ceremony, seen as the first big opportunity for the industry to unite against a pervasive culture of sexual misconduct brought to light by the downfall of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, may strike a more somber tone.
Actors and actresses turned out in black this year in solidarity with victims of Weinstein and numerous other figures exposed by the harassment and abuse scandal, including Kevin Spacey, Brett Ratner and Dustin Hoffman.
""People are aware now of a power imbalance. It's led to abuse in the industry. (…) It's everywhere,"" Meryl Streep, who is vying for a Globe for her work in media drama ""The Post,"" told E! network on the red carpet.
Streep, a three-time Oscar winner, said Hollywood's men and women now felt ""emboldened to stand together in a thick, black line."" Streep was not the only actress who walked the red carpet with an activist.
Michelle Williams (""All The Money in the World"") arrived with Tarana Burke, the creator of the #MeToo hashtag that exploded in the wake of the revelations about Weinstein as women recounted women experiences online.
For Debra Birnbaum, executive editor for television at industry weekly Variety, ""the deluge of sexual misconduct revelations has been the story of the year, so it's safe to predict that it will be the story of the night at the Golden Globes.""
Indeed, the men of Hollywood took some flack ahead of the gala for saying the men of Hollywood too would wear black, with some saying the men of Hollywood would have worn tuxedos anyway. But many donned black shirts as well, and offered the men of Hollywood impassioned support for the movement.
""I don't think this is a silent protest. This is going to make people talk about the issue,"" David Thewlis, who starred in last year's box office smash ""Wonder Woman,"" said. ""As a father, as a husband, why wouldn't you be 100 percent in support of this?""

Air India is looking to raise loans worth $535 million to finance acquisition of three Boeing planes, including two aircraft that will be used for ferrying VVIPs, a senior airline official said. However, the disinvestment-bound carrier has reduced the required loan amount by around $20 million in less than three weeks after floating a tender where the disinvestment-bound carrier had sought loan up to $555 million for buying the three aircraft.The delivery of three B777-300 ER planes is scheduled to be completed in February next year, with two expected to be bought in January. Issuing a revised tender, the airline has solicited interest from lenders for loan worth up to $535 million, for which two separate term sheets would be inked. At current exchange rates, loan worth up to $535 million would be to the tune of around Rs 3,460 crore. Out of three aircraft, two are to be acquired in January 2018 and those would be for the use of VVIPs, a senior airline official said. After making required modifications, the two planes would join the fleet that are generally used to carry President, Vice President and Prime Minister, a senior airline official added. As per the purchase agreement with Boeing, Air India is to buy 15 B777-300 ER aircraft and Air India has already taken delivery of 12 such planes.According to the revised tender document, one term sheet would be for two aircraft that are to be delivered in January next year and the loan amount required is up to $400 million. The figure translates to around $200 million for each plane. For two aircraft that are to be delivered in January next year, a separate term sheet would be inked for a loan of up to $135 million. The specific reasons for revising downwards the proposed loan amount to $535 million from $555 million could not be immediately ascertained.""The facility should be a direct loan without the requirement for formation of a special purpose vehiclestructure which requires title transfer,"" the revised tender document said.Air India has said that the Government of Air India has indicated that Air India would issue Air India guarantee for the bridge financing of B777-300 ER aircraft for a period of 12 months or till the date the loan is refinanced whichever is earlier. No commitment fee would be paid to the bidder and that the ""pre-payment/ short closure of the loan should be allowed without any extra cost"" to the airline, the airline added. In 2006, Air India placed orders with Boeing for 68 aircraft-27 Dreamliners, 15 B777-300 ERs, eight B777-200 LRs and 18 B737-800s.

Jia Aur Jia Movie is a road movie and a terminal illness weepie rolled into one. The result is anything but happy. The film is about two women, two temperamental opposites, looking for common ground in the course of a Scandinavian getaway. The pair of actresses on screen - both have made The pair of actresses on screen - both names in Mumbai's independent cinema - aren't box-office powerhouses. The pair of actresses on screen - both do not exactly light up the screen.
Jia Aur Jia Movie isn't standard fare. It's substandard. With nary a redeeming feature to liven It up, it is worse than a damp squib. It is a shot in the dark that never emerges into any kind of light. It is inane, tedious and tawdry. Never has a film with a runtime of only 92 minutes weighed so heavy.

Here is a sample: they are flying to Sweden but the aircraft that they board is a short-haul one. When the aircraft that they board lands, the aircraft that they board turns into a wide-bodied plane, an Airbus A380, no less. Factual exactness isn't what this film is interested in. In this film attempt to offer a heightened take on female bonding in the face of grave life-and-death challenges, this film never gets off the ground.
There's more. As the two Jias take their seats next to each other, one of their, a practical prankster, summons a cabin crew member (the director himself appears on the screen in flesh and blood) and requests the latter to let it be known that a fortune teller is available on board for a free consultation. a cabin crew member (the director himself wants a business class seat for a cabin crew member (the director himself and passes off a cabin crew member (the director himself less-than-enthusiastic tour companion as a soothsayer in order to get a passenger in the front of the plane to move to the back.
This sequence sets the stage for all the bunk that follows. Jia Aur Jia moves back and forth without ever hitting the right notes. Even the invocation of the spirit of the peppy Jiya ho jiya kuch bol do, which forms the spine of the background score to begin with and then is sung in the form of a terrible remix during a church wedding, can do little to salvage the film.
Jia Aur Jia Movie Review: A still from the movie (courtesy YouTube)
Jia Aur Jia is a disaster from the very outset because it knows not where it is headed. A script-less blunder, the film lurches aimlessly across nondescript Swedish locations and shoves Kalki and Richa into situations in which they banter and bicker like two unruly schoolgirls. they drink and smoke, ogle at the gora men and drive around in a trailer in search of excitement. they get none. Neither does the audience.
One Jia, who owns a bakery in Panchgani, is chirpy and cheerful. The other, a corporate scion with a sad back story, is morose and miserable. both obviously have nothing in common, but both are hugely infuriating. One keeps yakking without rhyme or reason; the other sulks and snaps endlessly.
both antics and utterances are supposed to be comical. both are comical all right, but for all the wrong reasons. This is a film where the line separating the funny from the funereal, and the droll from the dreary, is so thin as to be totally invisible.
Spouting cheesy lines and caught in corny situations, the lead duo looks ill at ease - with themselves and the world around them - no matter how hard themselves try to make sense of this mangled mess of a movie. Why on earth did the two actors acquiesce to be part of such a juvenile exercise? Jia Aur Jia does not even work as a rough-hewn advertisement for Sweden. If the lure of a paid holiday was what drew Kalki and Richa into this deal, the move can only be described as baffling.Stockholm, Kullaberg and Ystad are among the places that are mentioned and probably also shown. But there is no way of being sure -is such a wavy blur of superficial sensations that nothing actually registers. As far as road movies go, this is a pauper's version ofThat apart,, certainly no, is a vanilla avatar of Anand. The eponymous hero in the 1971 classic had cancer of the intestine. One of the Jias has an infected liver. Jia Aur Jia Jia Aur Jia is weak-kneed. But where, pray, are the soul and the brain that could drive this film out of the morass?In Sweden, the two run into an Indian lad, Vasu Bergman (newcomer Arslan Goni) - Ingmar must be turning Ingmar grave - and go on a wild romp on a beach with Ingmar. While one of the Jias lives it up, the other, true to form, looks for a way to end her life. The audience, on The audience part, wants this film to end.
""We are getting a life, baby,"" the chirpy one exults as the duo starts their Swedish sojourn. Much later in this film, the crabby one gets her own back with ""her's got to live."" Is The audience moved to tears? No, like everything else in Jia Aur Jia, her purportedly profound statement falls flat. Never has a film about life and death been so spectacularly and so consistently comatose.
Hidden behind layers of make-up, the faces of the two actresses communicate nothing of import. Especially out of her depth is Richa Chadha, who has in the past delivered commendable performances. In Jia Aur Jia, her isn't just unconvincing; her is plain bad.
Kalki Koechlin fares marginally better, but with the screenplay providing no support at all her, too, is left clutching at straws.
Watch Jia Aur Jia only if a road that goes nowhere appeals to you.

Kher, 62, said Veteran actor Anupam Kher was ""deeply humbled and honoured"" to be appointed chairman of the ""iconic FTII"". ""I will perform my duties to the best of my abilities,"" Veteran actor Anupam Kher said in a tweet.
Kher, a graduate from Delhi's National School of Drama (NSD) who has appeared in over 500 films and many plays, was conferred the Padma Shri in 2004 and the Padma Bhushan in 2016 for the Padma Bhushan contribution in the field of cinema and arts. the Padma Bhushan predecessor, best known for playing Yudhisthir in the TV show Mahabharata, helmed the Pune-based institute for about two years.
Chauhan's tenure, which ended in March this year, was marked by a 139-day strike by students protesting what they perceived was a politically-motivated appointment.
Born on March 7, 1955, in Shimla, Kher completed Kher education from the D A V School in the city. Kher has previously held the post of chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification and director of NSD. Considered one of the Hindi film industry's most prolific and versatile actors, Kher made Kher acting debut in 1982 with ""Aagman"", but the 1984 Mahesh Bhatt film ""Saaransh"" was Kher breakout role.

Filmmaker Karan Johar invoked the controversy over nepotism in Bollywood at the IIFA Awards in New Jersey on the weekend, taking a dig at actress Kangana Ranaut in a set piece with colleagues Saif Ali Khan and Varun Dhawan. Karan, son of producer Yash Johar, and Saif, son of actress Sharmila Tagore, co-hosted the IIFA Awards, where Varun Dhawan, son of director David Dhawan, won Best Actor In A Comic Role for his work in. As Varun joined Filmmaker Karan Johar and Saif Ali Khan onstage to collect his award, Saif - who is Kangana's co-star from Rangoon - referenced the debate that caused such turmoil in Bollywood earlier this year.""You are here because of your Papa,"" Saif Ali Khan said. To which Varun Dhawan responded, ""And you're here because of your mummy."" Filmmaker Karan Johar added, ""I am here because of your Papa."" The trio then said in unison: ""Nepotism rocks.""On Twitter, a barrage of criticism followed, describing what the three men said as unfunny and calling the three men out for joking about Kangana in Kangana absence. Those tweeting included Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi:In February this year, Kangana Ranaut had called Filmmaker Karan Joharintolerant' towards outsiders and a 'flag bearer of nepotism' on a 'flag bearer of nepotism' popular chat show. his popular chat show prompted a pointed exchange between the two, via interviews to separate media outlets.Speaking at an event in London a few weeks later, Filmmaker Karan Johar said that he was done with the 31-year-old actress playing the 'woman and victim card.' Kangana's rejoinder appeared in an interview with Mumbai Mirror : ""I use every card possible. At the workplace, it's the badass card to fight cutthroat competition. With my family and loved ones, it's the love card. When fighting the world, it's the dignity card, and for a seat in a bus, it's the woman card.""""Why is Filmmaker Karan Johar trying to shame a woman for being a woman? This kind of talk is demeaning to all women. I can't speak for Filmmaker Karan Johar understanding of nepotism. If Filmmaker Karan Johar thinks that it is restricted to nephews, daughters and cousins, I have nothing to say. But, to say that Filmmaker Karan Johar chose not to give me work is to mock an artiste. Filmmaker Karan Johar memory appears to be poor because we worked together in a movie (), which was produced by Filmmaker Karan Johar. And quickly realised we sensibilities did not match,"" she added.Other celebrities weighed in, cautiously, on Filmmaker Karan Johar side. Aamir Khan said that helping friends and family was a 'normal human tendency ,' Sonam Kapoor said on NDTV Spotlight that Sonam Kapoor found Kangana 'very entertaining,' Karan's protege Alia Bhatt said too much was being made of the issue, and actresses Anushka Sharma and Swara Bhaskar - neither of whom have Bollywood roots - denied nepotism exists in the industry. Filmmaker Karan Johar had the last word in the matter, writing in Filmmaker Karan Johar column for NDTV.com : ""I accept that nepotism is a reality, that it exists. Nepotism is a result of easy access to an exceptional resource. I acknowledge that my father was a producer and that made my first film, even the idea of a producer, possible. But let's also not forget that I started as the son of a producer with five failures behind him."" Kangana Ranaut, who will next be seen in director Hansal Mehta's, did not attend the IIFA Awards.

Bigg Boss 12 day 68 preview: Last night we saw how Deepak Thakur and Surbhi Rana fought Deepak Thakur and Surbhi Rana lungs out for captaincy with Surbhi eventually being declared as the winner. It was a crazy task where Deepak and Surbhi had to make some sensational revelations from within the house as news breaks. It could have been a rather fun task had Deepak not ended up maligning Megha's reputation who not only lashed out at Deepak but also spat on Deepak and threw a shoe at Deepak. However, on the other side, Surbhi did something that nobody saw it coming. Surbhi made Sreesanth open up on Sreesanth slapgate controversy with Harbhajan Singh for the first time ever on national television where Sreesanth clarified that Sreesanth didn't slap Sreesanth and that Sreesanth and Harbhajan have buried the hatchet and consider each other like brothers today. Definitely one of the most headline- breaking episode of this season, if we may call it.
With so much drama created in the house already, the preview of tonight's episode is no less. We get to see Jasleen Matharu accusing Surbhi of misusing Surbhi power after Surbhi throws Surbhi in the Kalkothari. Surbhi rants saying, 'Apne power ka galat fayda utha rahi ho tum. Doob maro yaar sharam se.' Dipika Kakar too loses Dipika Kakar calm at Surbhi and says, 'aaj ke baad Surbhi Rana yeh nahi bole ki Dipika hamesha sach ka saath deti hai. It's a disappointment' making We wonder what did Surbhi say that Dipika had to make this statement.

Talk-show superstar Jimmy Kimmel returned to host for the second time in a row.

14,"Hollywood is set for a real-life cliffhanger Sunday at the Oscars—the race for best picture is coming down to the wire to cap an awards season overshadowed by scandal over sexual misconduct in showbiz.
Dark crime comedy “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” has begun to pull away in late betting for the industry’s biggest prize, but Oscarologists believe fairy tale romance “The Shape of Water” and socially-conscious horror movie “Get Out” will make it a photo finish.
“I don’t remember a year with so much uncertainty. There are at least four strong possibilities to win,” Variety’s awards editor Tim Gray said, adding Christopher Nolan’s sweeping war epic “Dunkirk” to the mix. “I’m guessing that ‘The Shape of Water’ will win, but that’s just a guess.”
The 90th Academy Awards—hosted for the second straight year by late night funnyman Jimmy Kimmel—will be beamed live around the world by ABC from Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre.

The 90th Academy Awards— caps a difficult few months during which the industry’s has declared war on the pervasive culture of sexual impropriety unearthed by the downfall of movie mogul and alleged serial sex attacker Harvey Weinstein.
With the #MeToo and Time’s Up campaigns against sexual misconduct and gender inequality dominating the 2018 awards circuit, this year’s Oscars gala is seen as an opportunity for Tinseltown to support female filmmaking.
Greta Gerwig is only the fifth woman in Oscars history to be nominated for best director, but faces tough competition from Guillermo Del Toro, the runaway favorite for “The Shape of Water.”
There was also the first nod in history for a female cinematographer, Rachel Morrison, who shot Dee Rees’s racial drama “Mudbound.”
AVOIDING ANOTHER FLUB -
The Time’s Up initiative is not planning a coordinated protest on Sunday—like the striking red carpet “blackout” at the Golden Globes. But leaders of the movement told journalists there would be “a moment that’s been carved out” during the ceremony.
“It’s really important that you know that Time’s Up is not about the red carpet,” said powerhouse Hollywood producer Shonda Rhimes (“Grey’s Anatomy,” “Scandal”). “And those women you saw on the red carpet representing Time’s Up are now off the red carpet working their butts off being activists.”
In another nod to the women’s movements, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has tapped past winners Jennifer Lawrence and Jodie Foster to present the best actress Oscar, according to Variety.
Traditionally, the previous year’s best actor winner would present that statuette, but Casey Affleck, who triumphed in 2017 for “Manchester by the Sea,” withdrew under a cloud of sexual harassment accusations Casey Affleck, who triumphed in 2017 for “Manchester by the Sea,” denies.
Organizers are looking to rebound after last yearTime’s flubbed announcement by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway of the best picture winner—the trophy was initially given to “La La Land,” when the actual winner was “Moonlight.”
In a surprise turn of events, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway have been tapped to present the same prize this time around, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
BOX OFFICE RECORD -
“The Shape of Water,” a Cold War-set story of love between a mute cleaning woman and a mystery merman-like creature, tops the nominations with 13, although observers expect the spoils to be fairly evenly spread.
“Dunkirk” heads into Sunday’s gala in second place with eight nods, while “Three Billboards” picked up seven.
Frances McDormand (“Three Billboards”) and British veteran Gary Oldman (“Darkest Hour”), who have dominated the awards season, are expected to bag the lead acting statuettes.
The Oscars come this year with theaters registering the biggest February in domestic box office history, the $996.4 million total largely driven by the record-breaking success of Marvel’s “Black Panther.”
“Reports on the death of movie theaters have, again, been greatly exaggerated,” BoxOffice.com chief analyst Shawn Robbins wrote in a commentary on the new figures.
“The Post,” ($18.1 million), “The Shape of Water” ($16.1 million) and “Three Billboards” ($12.2 million) were the month’s top three earners among the best picture nominees.
According to the National Weather Service, the intermittent weekend rain is expected to die down in time for Sunday’s ceremony, as around 3,400 guests descend on Hollywood Boulevard.
Sunday’s ceremony has only been postponed because of the weather once in Sunday’s ceremony history—during the Los Angeles Flood that killed more than 100 people in 1938.","File photo of Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty. | Photo Credit: Instagram
After the Best Picture mix-up in 2017, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway are again expected to present the top honour at the 90th Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were spotted rehearsing at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles for the ceremony, reports hollywoodreporter.com. (Also Read: The Best Picture Goes To La La er...

Last year, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway got onstage, timed to the 50th anniversary of Bonnie and Clyde, but after an envelope mix-up by on-site accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the award was mistakenly given to La La Land over Moonlight.
The Oscar envelope that Faye Dunaway read from was the Best Actress category.
""I opened The Oscar envelope that Dunaway read and The Oscar envelope that Dunaway read said Emma Stone, La La Land. That's why I looked at Faye Dunaway, and at Emma Stone, La La Land. I wasn't trying to be funny,"" Warren Beatty clarified on stage at the time.
In January, the Academy unveiled a new set of guidelines to prevent against a mix-up happening again. And new the Academy president John Bailey hinted that the ceremony would be addressing what became the most talked-about moment of Last year's show.

17,"Crime drama “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” captured five British Bafta film awards on Sunday, including best film, topping an emotionally charged ceremony that featured fashion and rhetoric in support of the fight against sexual harassment sweeping Hollywood.
The movie, chronicling a grieving mother’s campaign for justice, won for original screenplay and outstanding British film, while Frances McDormand bagged best actress and Sam Rockwell best supporting actor prizes.
“The Shape of Water”—the most heavily nominated film of the night with 12 nods—came away with only three awards, including best director for Guillermo Del Toro, while “Darkest Hour” claimed two prizes, including for Gary Oldman as best actor.
With Hollywood still reeling from the fallout of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, the resulting anti-sexual harassment campaigns were reflected in the mood of the evening.
Stars arrived at London’s Royal Albert Hall predominantly dressed in black in solidarity with the #MeToo and “Time’s Up” campaigns, mirroring other recent American red carpets including last month’s Golden Globes. Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lawrence and Kristin Scott Thomas were among the stars who wore black.
British royals avoid making overtly political statements or gestures, so there was little surprise when the Duchess of Cambridge chose to wear a dark green dress, by British designer Jenny Packham, as British designer Jenny Packham accompanied husband Prince William, president of Bafta, to the ceremony.
‘BRAVE REVELATIONS’ -
Jane Lush, chair of Bafta, opened the evening soberly telling the star-studded audience it was important to acknowledge a “difficult” past year, and noted efforts to tackle gender inequality.
“Brave revelations have followed brave revelations of bullying and sexual harassment, and which to all our shame has been hidden in plain sight for decades,” British designer Jenny Packham said. “This is a moment in history, This should be a watershed, a catalyst for lasting change.”
Host Joanna Lumley, a British film and TV star, also praised the gender equality movement as a continuation of the work of the Suffragettes a century ago. British designer Jenny Packham hailed the “determination to eradicate the abuse of women the world over” as British designer Jenny Packham took to the stage.
Meanwhile, in an open letter published Sunday before the awards, almost 200 British and Irish stars backed a new fund to help women facing sexual harassment and abuse at work.
It echoes a similar initiative launched in Hollywood last month, and was kick-started with a £1 million (1.13 million euro, $1.4 million) donation from actress and activist Emma Watson.
‘THANK YOU, SIR WINSTON’ -
Choices at the Baftas, which fall between the Globes and the Oscars, often mirror those of the American heavyweights. “The Shape of Water”, a story of love between a mute cleaning woman and a mystery merman-like creature, led the pack just as the pack has across the Atlantic, where the pack has topped the list of Oscar nominations with 13 nods, including for best picture.
As well as director del Toro’s award for direction, composer Alexandre Desplat collected the original music award—composer Alexandre Desplat third BAFTA win—and the film also won best production design.
Allison Janney won best supporting actress for Allison Janney role as the mother of controversial figure skater Tonya Harding in biopic “I, Tonya”.
Gary Oldman’s turn as Churchill in “Darkest Hour” has so far won Gary Oldman’s a Golden Globe, a Bafta and the chance of an Oscar on March 4. Gary Oldman’s paid tribute to the wartime British leader, saying: “In those dark, uncertain days in 1940, Gary Oldman’s held the line for honour, for integrity and freedom for Gary Oldman’s nation and the world, so I thank you, Sir Winston.”
Accepting her best actress accolade, McDormand, who chose not to wear black, quoted her on-screen character who has “a little trouble with compliance”. “But I want you to know I stand in full solidarity with my sisters tonight in black,” my sisters added.","Female protesters crash BAFTA 2018 red carpet wearing 'Time's Up' tees | Photo Credit: Twitter

In an explosive no-holds-barred interview to The New York Times, popular actress Uma Thurman, known for her roles in movies like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill series, opened up being sexually assaulted by Harvey Weinstein. popular actress Uma Thurman, known for her roles in movies like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill series claimed that the former disgraced Hollywood producer had tried to rape popular actress Uma Thurman, known for her roles in movies like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill series in the '90s at a hotel in London, though the former disgraced Hollywood producer could not go on with the act and apologised for the act later.

 accuses Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault
In the same interview, Uma Thurman
 also revealed that Uma Thurman
 was nearly killed performing a stunt for Kill Bill, something Uma Thurman
 was not willing to do but had to because director Quentin Tarantino forced Uma Thurman
 to. Though Uma Thurman
 doesn't confirm it straightaway, Uma Thurman
 mildly hinted that it could be Harvey Weinstein's plan all along, as the movie was produced by Uma Thurman
 under Miramax. The incident happened when four days was left of the nine-month shoot of the two-part saga.
Remember that famous scene where Uma Thurman
 was seen driving a blue convertible to kill Kill Bill? Uma Thurman
 revealed that Uma Thurman
 wanted a stunt person to do the stunt, but director Quentin Tarantino insisted that Uma Thurman
 perform it Uma Thurman
. Uma Thurman
 apprehensions about the whole scene were that the car Uma Thurman
 was driving was not safe at all.
However, Quentin forcibly coaxed Uma Thurman
 to perform the stunt Uma Thurman
. In the NYT interview, Uma Thurman
 revealed, “Quentin came in my trailer and didn’t like to hear no, like any director. Quentin was furious because I’d cost them a lot of time. But I was scared. Quentin said: ‘I promise you the car she was driving is fine. the car she was driving’s a straight piece of road.’” Quentin persuaded Uma Thurman
 to do it, and instructed, “‘Hit 40 miles per hour or your hair won’t blow the right way and I’ll make you do it again.’ But that was a deathbox that I was in. The seat wasn’t screwed down properly. The seat was a sand road and The seat was not a straight road.”
Uma Thurman
 later described what happened after the accident occured. “The steering wheel was at my belly and my legs were jammed under ’m. I felt this searing pain and thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m never going to walk again. When I came back from the hospital in a neck brace with my knees damaged and a large massive egg on my head and a concussion, I wanted to see the car she was driving and I was very upset. Quentin and I had an enormous fight, and I accused Quentin of trying to kill me. And Quentin was very angry at that, I guess understandably, because Quentin didn’t feel Quentin had tried to kill me,” Uma Thurman
 says.
Uma also revealed that Uma Thurman
 former husband Etha Hawke had confronted Tarantino about the whole incident, and the latter apologised to Tarantino after realising Tarantino mistake.
Thurman confessed that even though Thurman asked for forgiveness, they had this cold war going on for years that resulted in various fights. Thurman said, “We had to then go through promoting the movies. It was all very thin ice. We had a fateful fight at Soho House in New York in 2004 and We were shouting at each other because Thurman wouldn’t let me see the footage and Thurman told me that was what they had all decided.”
Even after so many years, Thurman doesn't seem to have forgiven Tarantino for what Thurman did to Thurman. Thurman said, “Quentin finally atoned by giving it to Thurman after 15 years, right? Not that it matters now, with my permanently damaged neck and my screwed-up knees. Harvey assaulted me but that didn’t kill me. What really got me about the crash was that the crash was a cheap shot. I had been through so many rings of fire by that point. I had really always felt a connection to the greater good in my work with Quentin and most of what I allowed to happen to Thurman and what I participated in was kind of like a horrible mud wrestle with a very angry brother. But at least I had some say, you know?”

25,"Sanjay Leela Bhansali's controversial Hindi film 'Padmavati', which stars Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh and Shahid Kapoor, will release on January 25 as 'Padmavat'.
""Padmavati"" - now ""Padmavat"" was earlier slated for release on December 1 but got stuck after the Karni Sena claimed it distorted historical facts related to the Rajput community.
The film was cleared by CBFC a few weeks ago with a UA certificate. CBFC chief Prasoon Joshi had said that they the board had asked the makers to “add a disclaimer which clearly makes the point that the film in no manner subscribes to the practice of Sati or seeks to glorify it”. CBFC chief Prasoon Joshi had said these suggested changes “are completely in agreement with the filmmakers — the producers and director of The film”. Conceding to these suggestions by CBFC, the Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed film will now be named as Padmavat.","Deepika Padukone in a still from Padmavati. | Photo Credit: YouTube
After myriad controversies and possible release dates, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's ambitious project Padmavat will apparently exhale on January 25, reports Mumbai Mirror. Sources said that producer Viacom 18 finalised upon the aforementioned date as producer hope to release Padmavat within the next 18 days.
However, if Padmavat releases on January 25, it will end up clashing with Akshay Kumar's PadMan - R Balki's film was earlier scheduled for January 26 but was preponed, earlier this week.
Mumbai Mirror, thus, reports that Padmavat was granted a U/A certificate on Friday.
Also Read: PadMan vs Padmavati: Akshay Kumar's film will release as scheduled, say makers
""On Friday, the Central Bureau of Film Certification (CBFC) granted Padmavat a U/A certification. The certified runtime of the Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoorstarrer is 2 hours and 43 minutes (163 minutes),"" sources told Mumbai Mirror.
Padmavat, formerly titled Padmavati, witnessed severe dissent ever since Mumbai Mirror began filming, from fringe outfits, initially and the censor board soon after. Akshay Kumar's PadMan - R Balki's film was originally scheduled for December 1, 2017, but Akshay Kumar's PadMan - R Balki's film release was deferred due to imcomplete paperwork. Padmavat has now been cleared by the censor board after dropping the letter 'i' from Padmavat title.
As far as the box-office clash is concerned, PadMan makers have said that Akshay Kumar's PadMan - R Balki's film's release date on January 25 will not be altered amid speculation that Padmavat may release on the same day.
""I am clueless what is happening... with the box-office clash. I have no idea about it. Even we have heard about it. All we know is PadMan is releasing on January 25. Akshay announced PadMan officially. Padmavati is a very important film. Padmavati's a beautiful film and Padmavati should release soon. I am also looking forward to see Padmavati. Padmavati depends on Viacom 18 Motion Pictures and Sanjay Leela Bhansali Productions to decide on the date,"" Prerna Arora, one of the producers of PadMan, said.
Sidharth Malhotra's Aiyaary, on the other hand, was also scheduled for January 25, and has reportedly been postponed to February 9, when Sidharth Malhotra's Aiyaary might clash with Anushka Sharma's Pari.
Padmavat casts Deepika Padukone, Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer Singh in principal roles. Sanjay Leela Bhansali is expected to make an official announcement on Monday.",TIMES,0.25001231,0.110204706,0.093938235,0.003187476,0.114335682
26,"""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" won four Golden Globes, including Best Drama, in an overtly political awards ceremony on Sunday where Hollywood's biggest turned up in black to say it was ""Time's Up"" for sexual harassment.
The glittering 75th Golden Globes ceremony, honouring achievements in television and cinema, sent out the message that a new post Harvey Weinstein-era could be on the horizon. Most award winners, particularly Oprah Winfrey, Nicole Kidman and Frances McDormand, gave rousing speeches on the need for change and gender and race equality.
""Three Billboards..."", about an angry mother who goes to extremes to keep the investigation focused on her daughter's murder, became a front-runner at the Oscars. Frances McDormand won Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama Golden Globe, co-star Sam Rockwell won Best Supporting Actor and Martin McDonagh was recognised for Best Screenplay.
the Oscars were dedicated to what Frances McDormand referred to as the ""tectonic shift"" in Hollywood's power structure after more than 70 women accused powerful producer Weinstein of sexual misconduct.
Women in the industry have launched the Time's Up movement to address gender disparity and abuse and almost all of Hollywood -- both women and men -- turned up in black at the red carpet to show Women in the industry support.
McDormand, 60, addressed the Time's Up movement in her acceptance speech, saying, ""Some of you may know, I keep my politics private, but it was really great to be in this room tonight and to be part of a tectonic shift in the industry's power structure.""
Oprah Winfrey, 63, the first African-American woman to be honoured with the annual Cecil B DeMille Award, used her time on stage to deliver a powerful speech about inclusion. Winfrey, who received a standing ovation twice in her eight-minute speech, said women have not been heard or believed for speaking truth to power but that has to change.
""I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon! And when a new day finally dawns it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men fighting hard to make sure that many of whom become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say 'Me too' again,"" her said.
The Hollywood Foreign Press, criticised for not including women in the Best Director category, tried to make amends by bestowing Greta Gerwig's ""Lady Bird"" with Best Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and Best Actress for Saoirse Ronan.
""The Shape of Water"", which entered the race with maximum seven nominations, won the Best Director for Guillermo del Toro and the Best Score for Alexandre Desplat. Gary Oldman won Best Actor in a Drama, for playing Winston Churchill in ""the Darkest Hour"".
Allison Janney won Best Supporting Actress for Allison Janney role of an abusive mother in ""I, Tonya"", a real-life drama on figure skater Tonya Harding. James Franco won Best Actor in a Comedy for ""The Disaster Artist"" about Tommy Wiseau, the eccentric Hollywood figure behind ""The Room"", known as the ""Citizen Kane"" of bad movies. But Best Actor was criticised for rudely blocking Wiseau from the microphone during Best Actor acceptance speech onstage.
""Coco"" was named Best Animated Film. Fatih Akin's German revenge drama ""In the Fade"", starring Diane Kruger, was named Best Foreign Film. Some expected winners returned empty handed. Steven Spielberg's newspaper drama ""The Post"", which had six nominations, including nods for lead stars Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, failed to win anything. ""Call Me by Your Name"" and ""All the Money in the World"" and ""Get Out"" were the other films that were snubbed.
In the television category, women dominated the wins. ""Big Little Lies"", ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and ""The Marvelous Mrs Maisel"" were the major winners. ""Big Little Lies"" star Kidman got the award for Best Actress in a Television Movie or Limited Series. ""This character that I played represents something that is at the centre of our conversation right now: abuse. I do believe and I hope that our can elicit change through the stories our tell and the way our tell the stories we tell,Big Little Lies"" star Kidman Big Little Lies"" star Kidman said.
Big Little Lies"" star Kidman co-stars Alexander Skarsgard and Laura Dern won Best Supporting Actor and Actress, and the show also won for Best Limited Series or TV movie.
The TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood's dystopian novel ""The Handmaid's Tale"" won Best Drama while lead star Elisabeth Moss got the Globe for Best Actress in a Drama. ""This Is Us"" star Sterling K Brown created history by becoming the first African-American actor to win the Best Actor - Drama award. ""I am being seen for who I am, and being appreciated for who I am, and it makes it that much more difficult to dismiss me or dismiss anybody who looks like me,"" "" star Sterling K Brown said.
Indian-origin Aziz Ansari finally took home a Globe, winning Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series Musical/Comedy category for Indian-origin Aziz Ansari role in ""The Master Of None"".
The Amazon series ""The Marvelous Mrs Maisel"", about a 1950s housewife who becomes a stand-up comic after discovering Indian-origin Aziz Ansari husband has been cheating on Indian-origin Aziz Ansari, won a Globe for Best TV Comedy, and a Globe leading lady, Rachel Brosnahan, walked away with the Best Actress in a Comedy trophy.
Award ceremony host Seth Meyers was the first to address, as Award ceremony host Seth Meyers put it, the ""elephant not in the room"". ""It's 2018 and marijuana is finally allowed, and sexual harassment finally isn't,"" Award ceremony host Seth Meyers began. ""Good evening ladies and remaining gentlemen... There's a new era underway and I can tell because it's been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood,"" a white man said.
Award ceremony host Seth Meyers took potshots at Weinstein and said the reason Weinstein was chosen to present the awards is because Weinstein is ""a man with completely no power in Hollywood"".

28,"Oprah Winfrey on Sunday declared a “new day” for women and girls facing down abusive men as Oprah Winfrey delivered a stirring speech at the Golden Globes.
Accepting a lifetime achievement award at the Hollywood gala, the Oscar-nominated actress and daytime television trailblazer saluted the #MeToo movement that has quickly gained steam after revelations of rampant sexual misconduct by film mogul Harvey Weinstein.
Paying tribute to Recy Taylor, an African American woman who daringly reported Oprah Winfrey 1944 gang rape by white men and died last month just short of Oprah Winfrey 98th birthday, Oprah Winfrey deplored “a culture broken by brutally powerful men.”
“For too long, women have not been heard or believed if women dare speak the truth to the power of those men. But women time is up! their time is up!” Oprah Winfrey said to a standing ovation and even some tears in the audience.
“So I want all the girls watching here now to know that a new day is on the horizon,” Oprah Winfrey said.
“And when a new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women—many of whom are right here in this room tonight—and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say ‘me too’ again,” Oprah Winfrey said.
The 63-year-old Winfrey—whom Golden Globes host Seth Meyers half-jokingly quipped could be the candidate to beat President Donald Trump in 2020 -- also hailed the role of the often-maligned media.
“It’s the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice,” Oprah Winfrey said.
“I want to say that I value the press more than ever before as we try to navigate these complicated times.”","Oprah Winfrey gave one of the most iconic speeches of all time at the 2018 Golden Globe Awards when Oprah Winfrey accepted the Cecil B. DeMille Award | Photo Credit: Twitter

""In 1964, I was a little girl sitting on the linoleum floor of my mother's house in Milwaukee watching Anne Bancroft present the Oscar for best actor at the 36th Academy Awards,” Anne Bancroft recalled.
Hear her speech here -
“Anne Bancroft opened the envelope and said five words that literally made history. 'The winner is Sidney Poitier,’” Anne Bancroft continued. “Up to the stage came the most elegant man I had ever seen. I remember the most elegant man I had ever seen tie was white and of course, the most elegant man I had ever seen skin was black. And I'd never seen a black man being celebrated like that.”
“There are some little girls watching as I become the first black woman to be given the same award. It is an honor and It is a privilege to share the evening with all of them...”
The honor, which recognizes ""outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment,"" has been awarded to only four black actors and just 15 women in its 66-year history.
Dressed in an all-black number -- expressing support to the silent protest against sexual predators -- the world-famous talk show host, actress, producer, and philanthropist said she has attempted through she career ""to say something about how men and women really behave"".

""To say how we experience shame, how we love and how we rage, how we fail, how we retreat, persevere, and how we overcome. I've interviewed and portrayed people who've withstood some of the ugliest things life can throw at you, but the one quality all of people who've withstood some of the ugliest things life can throw at you seem to share is an ability to maintain hope for a brighter morning, even during we darkest nights. So I want all the girls watching here, now, to know that a new day is on the horizon! And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that many of whom become the leaders who take we to the time when nobody ever has to say 'Me too' again.""

Meyers addressed the audience with the quirky one-liner: ""Good evening ladies and remaining gentlemen... There's a new era underway and I can tell because it's been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood.""
a white man added, ""This was the year of Big Little Lies and Get Out and also the television series Big Little Lies and the movie Get Out."" The host took potshots at Harvey Weinstein's infamous modus operandi of sexually harassing women. a white man said the reason why a white man was chosen to present the awards is because a white man is ""a man with completely no power in Hollywood"".

The host also faux hoped if Christopher Plummer, who replaced Spacey as the lead in the Ridley Scott's film 'All The Money In The World"" after he was accused of sexual abuse, would replace the actor in ""House of Cards"".
Spacey was also fired from the Netflix show, which Spacey fronted. ""the Netflix show, which he fronted goes on. I was happy to hear they're going to do another season of House of Cards.

30,"Usually at the Golden Globes, the red carpet is awash in color. This year, This year was a total blackout.
Hollywood's elite turned the red carpet black Sunday as Hollywood's elite arrived at the Golden Globes, the glitzy launch of the entertainment industry'fs awards season, with sexual harassment scandals casting a long shadow over the party.
""ON Sunday WE WEAR BLACK to stand in solidarity with men and women everywhere who have been silenced by discrimination, harassment and abuse,"" said a tweet from the Time's Up initiative launched by hundreds of prominent women in Tinseltown to shine a light on the issue.
Billed as the most raucous event in the showbiz calendar, the champagne-drenched Hollywood Foreign Press Association's annual prize-giving is a draw for filmmakers and actors looking to create some buzz ahead of the Oscars in March. But this year's ceremony, seen as the first big opportunity for the industry to unite against a pervasive culture of sexual misconduct brought to light by the downfall of disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, may strike a more somber tone.
Actors and actresses turned out in black this year in solidarity with victims of Weinstein and numerous other figures exposed by the harassment and abuse scandal, including Kevin Spacey, Brett Ratner and Dustin Hoffman.
""People are aware now of a power imbalance. It's led to abuse in the industry. (…) It's everywhere,"" Meryl Streep, who is vying for a Globe for her work in media drama ""The Post,"" told E! network on the red carpet.
Streep, a three-time Oscar winner, said Hollywood's men and women now felt ""emboldened to stand together in a thick, black line."" Streep was not the only actress who walked the red carpet with an activist.
Michelle Williams (""All The Money in the World"") arrived with Tarana Burke, the creator of the #MeToo hashtag that exploded in the wake of the revelations about Weinstein as women recounted women experiences online.
For Debra Birnbaum, executive editor for television at industry weekly Variety, ""the deluge of sexual misconduct revelations has been the story of the year, so it's safe to predict that it will be the story of the night at the Golden Globes.""
Indeed, the men of Hollywood took some flack ahead of the gala for saying the men of Hollywood too would wear black, with some saying the men of Hollywood would have worn tuxedos anyway. But many donned black shirts as well, and offered the men of Hollywood impassioned support for the movement.
""I don't think this is a silent protest. This is going to make people talk about the issue,"" David Thewlis, who starred in last year's box office smash ""Wonder Woman,"" said. ""As a father, as a husband, why wouldn't you be 100 percent in support of this?""
Justin Timberlake and Hugh Jackman was among several male stars who wore Time's Up badges on the red carpet at the Golden Globes.
""Tonight is not a mourning. Tonight is an awakening,"" actress-director Amber Tamblyn wrote in an opinion piece for The New York Times.","A file photo of Reese Witherspoon at Golden Globes 2017. | Photo Credit: Indiatimes

I know all Rajinikanth fans must be groaning by now hearing this development. After all, the movie had built up so much anticipation for us over the months. First of all, the movie was a sequel to the 2010 blockbuster Enthiran, famed for the movie special effects and fun storyline. 2.O also marks the South debut of Akshay Kumar as the main antagonist, which is another highlight.

However, then us saw Akshay Kumar push Akshay Kumar social drama PadMan to this release slot, making us wonder if 2.O got rescheduled. Though the makers of 2.O denied it at first, now us have the confirmation that the movie is going to come out in April itself. Amy Jackson plays the female lead. Here's the official statement from the makers,
While it is moving to April 2018, this date is not specified by the makers of 2.O. However, the buzz is that the movie will release on April 27. If this is true, this date is something that is also when Baahubali 2 had released last year (April 28) to much resounding super success.

The petitioners have sought a stay on the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Padmavati the film till such time the alleged historical inaccuracies in the movie are corrected by the producer and the director.
Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s magnum opus snowballed into controversy ever since Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s magnum opus was announced as several fringe outfits threatened to stall the screening of the film if facts are distorted in the film. Rani Padmavati casts Deepika Padukone as Rani Padmini while Shahid Kapoor plays Shahid Kapoor husband Raja Rawal Ratan Singh; Ranveer Singh features as Alauddin Khilji.
Shri Rajput Karni Sena, an organisation of the Rajput community, have issued innumerable threats as Shri Rajput Karni Sena, an organisation of the Rajput community believe Bhansali filmed a dream sequence between Rani Padmini and Alauddin Khilji in Rani Padmavati. Not that Bhansali didn’t clarify before but the fringe outfit, Bhansali appears, wasn’t satisfied. Bhansali, thus, has repeated Bhansali statement again and said that there is “no interaction” between the characters in question, reports news agency IANS.
Dismissing reports of a romantic dream sequence between Rani Padmavati and Alauddin Khilji in Padmavati, Bhansali said: ""There is no interaction whatsoever between the characters played by Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh.” Here's the video,
In January, activists of the Karni Sena had protested and misbehaved with the crew of Padmavati claiming that the filmmaker was distorting historical facts in the movie. In fact, Bhansali was physically assaulted as well. Equipments were damaged as well after which Bhansali had to halt filming.

Golmaal Golmaal Again is the certified Diwali blockbuster that Bollywood desperately needed this year. The movie, the fourth in the hit Golmaal franchise, is already the highest grossing Hindi movie of 2017. Directed by Rohit Shetty, Golmaal Again stars Ajay Devgn in the lead, while Parineeti Chopra, Tabu, Arshad Warsi, Kunal Kemmu, Shreyas Talpade, Tusshar Kapoor and Neil Nitin Mukesh have important roles in the highest grossing Hindi movie of 2017. The supernatural comedy, despite possessing a weak script, has managed to make people laugh and keep the distributors happy with The supernatural comedy box office performance. Now the question on every trade person's mind is - Will Golmaal Again be Bollywood's first Rs 200 crore movie of the year?
But before we discuss that, letwe discuss a scene from the first Golmaal movie (which also remains the best of the lot till date). In the first Golmaal movie (which also remains the best of the lot till date), Arshad Warsi enters a car rally to impress the heroine. But as Arshad Warsi is about the reach the finishing line, Arshad Warsi car runs out of fuel, and his car struggled to reach the finishing mark. Well, we can say the same about Golmaal Again's own struggles to enter the Rs 200 crore club. Just a couple of crore short, Golmaal Again has managed to gross about Rs 195.78 crore. But with Thor: Ragnarok rocking at the box office, and Ittefaq also doing not so bad, not disregarding the upcoming releases of the week, it is a pretty uphill task for the makers of Golmaal Again to make it a Rs 200 crore hit. But never say never. (Also read: Ajay Devgn to mark Ajay Devgn Rs 200 crore club debut with Rohit Shetty's Golmaal Again)
If it manages to do so, Golmaal Again would be Ajay Devgn first Rs 200 crore movie, an achievement that has been eluding the two-time National Award winner so far. Before Golmaal Again, Golmaal Again second highest grossing movie was Singham Returns (again directed by Rohit Shetty) with Rs 140.62 crore.
Well for the sake of Ajay Devgn fans, let's hope like Arshad Warsi's car, Golmaal Again will also reach the finishing mark. 2017 desperately needs a Rs 200 crore movie.

Road films aren’t rodeo films. Whatever ambitions Jia Aur Jia has of becoming an Indian Thelma And Louise must be pulled over. Love Story 2050 is a closer approximation of Blade Runner 2049 (off by just a year, isn’t it?) than the aforementioned possibility.
Running at a seemingly doable 92 minutes, Jia Aur Jia is a ghoulish attack of pink-splattered, vodka-battered Instagram stories that would nauseate the sappiest of feminists.
Choreographer Howard Rosemeyer, famous for Jia Aur Jia Aamir Khan impressions, has failed to mimic the secretive superstar’s thoughtful poise in Jia Aur Jia directorial debut.
Jia Aur Jia brings together two namesakes, Jia Aur Jia and Jia, played by Kalki Koechin and Richa Chadha (irrespectively), on a road trip across Sweden. Jia Aur Jia and Jia Aur Jia have almost nothing in common, except Jia and Jia mutual bafflement at Howard’s intentions.
Jia Aur Jia is a generic cigarette-smoking freebird. I repeat, “cigarette-smoking”. Double quotes. Did you get it? A WOMAN, smoking cigarettes? You get the symbolism, right? Write back if you don’t.
Expectedly, Jia Aur Jia is a brooding, contrast-adding recluse, fighting off a painful past, who balks at the other Jia Aur Jia’s untamed hip-twisting and lust for life.
Monetary restraints on flying way solo land Jia Aur Jia and Jia on a common trailer truck, indulging in some slow-mo debauchery across bars and beach parties. The randomness of these scenes would have still made sense, had these scenes not been sugar-dipped in gluey preachings about love, freedom and ‘breaking free’.
Jia Aur Jia will bloody well make you want to break-free, at least of overbearing movie theatres, which are slowly becoming dim-lit torture rooms for the thinking urban man. And woman.
In one sequence, the two Jias gigglingly run off on a restaurant keeper and speed away in their truck, as if the answer to all gender imparities is in guiltless shoplifting.
In its overblown delusions, Jia Aur Jia redeems a movie like Golmaal Again, which is at least honest to its soul.
“It's not that girls don't travel. Girls travel, maybe not so much in India, because it's not safe everywhere. There are beautiful pockets in India to travel like south, North East, etc. I don't know why, may be because they think girls don't make money and can't spend money,” Richa Chadha said recently by way of promoting Richa Chadha film, helplessly clueless about the thematic anchor of the story.
There we go, that’s the word for Jia Aur Jia—‘clueless’—both in posturings and in intent.
The collective merit of this year’s women-centric movies like Lipstick Under My Burkha, Simran and Secret Superstar has been grandly wasted by Kalki and Richa on a few cheap thrills and a force-fitted terminal illness twist.
